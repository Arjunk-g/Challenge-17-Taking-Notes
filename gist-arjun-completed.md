# Title (replace with your title)

Regex is a way to translate and parse strings using particular values that have been either preassigned or that you can assign using slashes assigning them to a specified key.

## Summary

^gray|grey$

This will return a true boolean value since regex will associate the up arrow and dollar sign as anchors as how the value starts and ends.
